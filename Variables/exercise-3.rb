#Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.

# puts "what is your name?"
# name = gets.chomp
# puts "Hello " + name + ".  That's a fine name right there."

# 10 times name

10.times do
  puts name
end
