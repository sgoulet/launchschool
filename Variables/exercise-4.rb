#Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

puts "what is your first name?"
first_name = gets.chomp
puts "gracias.  what is your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp
puts "great.  so your full name is " + first_name + " " + last_name
