# What will each block of code below print to the screen? Write your answer on a piece of paper or in a text editor and then run each block of code to see if you were correct.

# 1. '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

# 2. x = 2
#    if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
#      puts "Did you get it right?"
#    else
#      puts "Did you?"
#    end

# 3. y = 9
#    x = 10
#    if (x + 1) <= (y)
#      puts "Alright."
#    elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
#      puts "Alright now!"
#    elsif (y + 1) == x
#      puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
#    else
#      puts "Alrighty!"
#    end

#The 1st block of code will return a FALSE because the string cannot equal an integer.  The 2nd block of code will return a "Did you get it right?".  Finally, the 3rd block of code will return an "Alright now!".
